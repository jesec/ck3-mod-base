Hello everyone! We're releasing a hotfix today to address some of the issues with yesterday's 1.10.0 update. While we have fixes for other reported/known issues coming up shortly, we felt the ones listed below were severe enough to warrant an immediate update.

## 1.10.0.1 'Quill' Hotfix Changelog

-   Fixed an issue where AI rulers do not marry as much as intended.
-   Fixed an issue that removed the two buttons under the Wards tab in the character interface.
-   Fixed an issue resulting in crashes for resumed games from older versions.

As always, if you encounter any problems not listed in [our known issues thread](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/known-issues-version-1-10-0.1596779/), then please let us know about it either in [the Community Support board](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1158310/discussions/1/) here on our Steam hub or through [the bug report board on our official forums](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/crusader-kings-iii-bug-report.1143/). We hope this hotfix makes for a more stable and enjoyable experience playing Wards & Wardens and the 1.10.0 'Quill' Update.
