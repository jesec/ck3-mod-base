# PC Update 1.13.0.4 Changelog

## Bugfixes

​

-   The game will now run expensive portrait script every few frames instead of every frame, to improve FPS.
-   Fixed several triggers erroneously including Adventurers in the ending decisions for the Iberian Struggle, making them near impossible to succeed.
-   Fixed recreating Byzantium via the Decision not setting the correct State Faith
-   Fixed not being able to use interactions on Wanderers as an Adventurer.
-   Removed unnecessary blockers for owning expansions on achievements that didn't warrant them.
-   Fixed 'A Legacy to Last the Ages' Achievement not unlocking with newer legacy tracks.

## Balance​

-   Adventurers can no longer use a hook to force faith conversion of landed rulers (that option was supposed to be restricted to lieges)

## Interface

​

-   Added a task contract icon to the bottom-right of the HUD, next to Schemes. It should be easier now to find and access your currently active contracts, to check their status or to abandon them.
