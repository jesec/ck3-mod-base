---

Hello everyone! We're releasing a sizeable update today to tackle some balance and interface issues affecting Roads to Power and the associated 1.13x "Basileus" Update. Notable changes include reducing the maintenance cost of Akritai men-at-arms, ensuring that factions have at least one member who actually wants to be there, and a myriad of bug fixes. See the changelog below for a full list of changes.

# PC Update 1.13.1 Changelog

## Balance

​

-   Significantly reduced the maintenance cost of Akritai. Due to a math error, the cost was way higher than intended. Math is hard.
-   Increased the AI weights for estate buildings slightly. The AI should hopefully construct new buildings more evenly between holdings and estate compared to before.
-   Landless administrative characters can no longer use the “Request governorship” interaction on titles held by non-admin rulers.
-   Changed the AI slightly for how likely it is to use the “Adopt state faith” decision.
    -   Reduced the base chance and made zealous characters never wanting to do it, but added a few additional modifiers which increases the overall chance.
-   Updated the “Adopt state faith” decision to be available to all vassals, regardless of government type, when the top liege has a state faith.
-   Adjusted the AI acceptance for requesting a council position in exchange for influence to make it a bit more difficult to become a councilor.
    -   The AI is now more reluctant to accept if your skill is significantly lower than the target councilor's, but is in return more likely to accept if you belong to a powerful family while the councilor does not.
-   Instead of making it more likely for the AI to adopt administrative government if they have the hereditary hierarchy cultural tradition, the tradition will instead slightly reduce the AI's willingness to become administrative.
-   Updated several cases of when administrative rulers are forced to change government in order to better transition into a government type you would expect. The government a character gets should be more consistent across the board as a result.
-   Updated the cost logic in the Depose Governor interaction and how it uses Governor Efficiency to influence the cost.

## Bugfixes

​

-   Fixed the AI not upgrading more than one internal slot in their Domiciles.
-   Fixed game lobby so you can create landless adventurers in theocratic or republic realms.
-   Made sure that not every single member of a faction could have been forced to be there. You figure at some point someone would ask the awkward question if everybody actually wants to start a rebellion.
-   Fix locked domicile building slot tooltip.
-   Clarified “The X path — ascension” tooltip to inform the player that the holy site used must also worship your faith.
-   We now display how many marriageable characters a ruler has when using “Make a request,” including filtering out anyone they'd be unlikely to offer in marriage.
-   “Become an adventurer” decision will now list all cultural traditions and faith tenets that unlock the decision, and not just the really cool ones.
-   Fixed an issue where a diarch could become independent and be called co-co-co-co-co... and so on. This should hopefully no longer happen.
-   Fixed the selected amount of influence in the request imperial expedition interaction not matching the threshold at which you can force your liege to accept. Now, if the liege doesn't have enough influence compared to how much you are spending, the liege will always say yes.
-   The imperial expedition cb is now only visible in the list of cbs when you are the co-emperor.
-   Corrected a niche issue where the increase county control contract could get into an infinite rewards loop if only one county was valid.
-   Made sure the right ship models were used while traveling, instead of always falling back to the default ship model.
-   The governance issue "Public Land" should no longer target dead characters. They've earned their final rest.
-   Added a tooltip for the mandatory admittance fee to the chariot races.
-   The “Confirm governor” decision now tells you what you'll get if your audience is accepted.
-   Added a missing loc key label to the tooltip for offering a eunuch to someone you have a hook on.

-   Corrected a minor temporal anomaly in the event loc for “A bit of gold” event.
-   Corrected some minor issues in the populist faction copy for administrative realms.
-   Added missing event option reasons for the head groom, kenneler, and chief engineer camp officers.
-   Corrected an issue where the faith ascension events could refer to your own faith as flawed (which, naturally, it definitely, definitely couldn't be).
-   Fixed a minor typo in the “Abundant initiative” eunuch event.
-   Ransom cages now correctly unlock the abduct scheme for adventurers regardless of whether they have the appropriate perk or not.
-   In administrative realms the most powerful noble family heads are now considered as ‘powerful vassals’

-   Added reduce stress as a valid intent for attending chariot races, so that everyone can attend medieval nascar for something other than politics.
-   Adjusted clan succession. Friendly and harmonious gave the player heir a smaller portion of your titles than intended (33% and 66% respectively). Values have been increased to 50% and 75%.
-   Made the grant title blocker loc for giving governors a second title of their highest held tier a little more precise.

-   Enabled event on caliph death in the hasan story cycle to be able to progress the story on the assassins path even if the caliphate had no heir.
-   Put in some extra exception logic to help stop co-emperors from occasionally silently invalidating out of their positions.
-   Appointing someone your co-ruler now moves them to your court/retracts their sub-vassal status, if appropriate.

-   Court positions that cost no upkeep for adventurers now correctly tooltip the reason they're free in their salary breakdown.
-   Made it possible for bookmakers to be terrible by lowering their base aptitude slightly.
-   Forced the bookmaker to stop tricking their employer. The chariot race cost reduction provided by said court position now correctly scales with their level of aptitude, as stated by the description.
-   Now prevents war leaders from disbanding their armies, instantly losing the war. Secondary war participants are always allowed to disband their armies in their domicile location.
-   The “Adopt State Faith” decision will now correctly tell you that the decision is unavailable when you are involved in an activity.
-   Fixed a case of AI reasoning related to being a powerful vassal not showing the value of how much it affected the acceptance.

-   Succeeding at impersonating as a tax collector as part of a landless adventurer contract will now properly grant the critical success reward.

-   Added new text for the influence gained of being a co-emperor.
-   When a scheme target is ambitious, the text will now specify that it is, in fact, the target that has the trait.
-   Target's learning impact in the challenge status scheme now clearly indicates that it's the target's learning skill we are looking at.

-   Fixed numerous issues with the Duchy Expansion CB. Rather than always attempting to take the title, it will primarily vassalize the target if possible, and only usurp the title when applicable.

## History

​

## Game Content

​

-   Added a new decision for administrative government, allowing characters to renounce any and all efforts to gain the throne, preventing the ai from supporting you and significantly reducing your candidate score. this should make it vastly easier to avoid becoming the emperor when you don't want to, yet be valid to compete for governorships.

-   Made it possible to override the background on interactions via script.
