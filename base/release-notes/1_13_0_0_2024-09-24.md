    -   Added special Men-at-Arms refill mechanics for adventurers.
        -   They pay no maintenance on their armies, but do not refill them naturally. Instead, they have a brace of interactions that they can take to refill them in exchange for currency costs.
        -   Successfully sieging holdings also returns a small amount of troops, enough for their armies to recoup most siege losses (and maybe a little extra) most of the time.
    -   Added 28 camp officers, the adventurer equivalent of court positions (which they generally replace), most of which are unlocked by different domicile upgrades.
    -   Added Visit Settlement decision, allowing adventurers to explore the holdings they pass through.

# Free Features

\[list\] <\*> Added new game rules

-   Name of Byzantium - Don’t like the name of the Byzantine Empire? Pick the name you like the most with several options available!
-   Added game rule for giving the historic ruler of Munster, Toirdelbach Mac Tadg, his rightful fiefdom (including becoming the player character if Murchad was selected; with credit to maniacal inc's thorough video on the subject for the switcharoo).
-   Added a game rule allowing manual determination of the Conquest of England's victor in 1066. If left to default, this will be overridden if Hereward is a player and no one else is playing a key belligerent.
-   Added a small slew of game rules for turning various arguably-administrative historical empires (plus the Carolingians, who only recently transitioned out of being administrative) into administrative empires, even if these realms aren't best suited to the mechanics of the government or already have their own distinct government flavors.
-   Added game rules to turn off the Iberian Struggle and/or Iranian Intermezzo mechanics, should you wish to play without them.
-   Added an optional game rule for restricting the creation of new empire titles neighboring/sharing a de jure with existing empires unless you have a stronger military, are married to their close family, or have a strong hook on them.

<\*> Added a new start date, 1178, featuring two bookmarks: Call of the Empire and Swords of Faith. <\*> Added a grand city style event for visiting Constantinople while traveling. <\*> Added the ‘Conqueror’ feature - rulers across the world can now be designated as a great conqueror, giving them special bonuses, content, and altering their AI behavior.

-   Conquerors switch over to a hyper-aggressive version of the AI, which is much faster to declare wars, can declare multiple wars at once, and invests all of their resources into warfare, Men at Arms, and means with which to declare more and better wars (such as hunt activities if they’re low on prestige and you’ve disabled their special bonuses via game rules, or taxation tours if they’re low on gold, etc.). They switch to the objectively best lifestyle focuses, use schemes in a very realpolitik way, etc.
-   Frequency, inheritance, and extra bonuses are fully customizable via Game Rules.

<\*> Added Message Settings: customize notifications to your own liking to have them appear in the message feed, as toasts, or pop-ups. <\*> Added the Vassal Directives feature - You will now be able to give Directives to your vassals, presuming that they respect you!

-   Directives are either given from the character interaction menu, or via the ‘Vassals’ tab in My Realm, the latter having the benefit of showing you the current directive. All government types can issue directives to their vassals - if you fulfill the triggers!
-   Administrative realms can give directives without the Vassal being able to refuse.

<\*> Historical Characters can now appear across the map!

-   Historical Characters such as Hildegard von Bingen or Ibn Battuta will appear in their historical birthplaces and seek employment with the local ruler. Recruit them, or set them on their own path throughout the world!
-   Customize how you’re notified of their appearance via a new Game Rule.
-   If you own Roads to Power, you can set out as an Adventurer as one of these characters should they spawn in your realm.

<\*> Choose a New Destiny

-   When you die, you now get the opportunity to switch to another character of your Dynasty that is not necessarily your direct Heir. Our game is a dynastic simulator, and we want to unlock playing through more branches of your Dynasty!
-   Players will be offered up to three categories of Destiny characters: An Interesting Destiny, a Challenging Destiny, and an Adventurous Destiny. Each category aims to offer a different flavor. The last category specifically will allow you to go Adventuring, if you own Roads to Power!
-   You can also select a Favorite Child (direct child or grand-child), who will then always appear as a New Destiny character. They will not get any extra titles or gold - in fact their siblings might get a bit jealous of their ‘favorite’ status.
-   For those who like to roll the Die of Fate - we have a special “Random Destiny” option with several random variants, to continue as any Dynasty character. It might still be your Heir, if that is what Fate determines.
-   You only get to Choose a New Destiny if you have a valid heir when you die. Securing your succession is an important part of CK3, and we want everyone to keep respecting that goal.

<\*> Character of the Week: Each week a new character will be highlighted when you start the game, giving you information about them and a suggestion for goals to achieve! <\*> Music Player: Pick the track you want to listen to and customize which tracks to play <\*> Reworked the Scheme System

-   Schemes have been reworked to include several new parameters, affecting the overall success and progression of any given scheme
-   Success Chance: The current success chance of a scheme
-   Potential: The maximum potential success chance a scheme may get
-   Phases: Schemes have phases, where the length can vary between different types, which increases success chance and provides advantages with each completed phase
-   Secrecy: How likely it is a scheme is discovered over time and when the scheme is executed
-   Breaches: The number of time a scheme is discovered - Gain enough breaches and the scheme will fail
-   Advantages: Spend these to recruit agents and increase the success chance when the scheme is executed
-   Schemes utilizing agents now have dedicated agent slots - Each agent boosts the scheme in different ways
