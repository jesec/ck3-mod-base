# All Under Heaven & 1.18.0 "Crane" Update - Now Available

**Release Date:** 2025-10-28
**Official Announcement:** https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/498336168563182789

---

Hello everybody! Today we are releasing our Major Expansion for the year and the centerpiece of Chapter IV: All Under Heaven. We're also releasing Update 1.18.0 ‘Crane’ alongside this expansion.

All of us at Studio Black here in Stockholm are so excited to share this with you. All Under Heaven might just be the biggest expansion we've made for Crusader Kings III. Growing the map by roughly 30% has definitely had its challenges, but it's been a long-term ambition of ours to establish a complete map of the Old World as a base to build on. 

We hope that you all will have as great a time playing All Under Heaven as we did creating it!

Signed,

Alexander Oltner, Game Director

Henrik Lohmander, Design Lead

Lucia Dzediti, Producer

Daan Broekhof, Programmer / Code Owner

Jacob Blakey, Community Manager

and everyone else at Paradox Studio Black and Paradox Interactive

Check out the release trailer below, and a partial changelog under that. The full changelog is well beyond the limits of what we can fit into a Steam announcement, so check out our forums for a more comprehensive list of changes coming in today’s update!

# Expansion Features (Paid) China

\[list\]\[\*\]

Added Celestial Government: A new government type heavily inspired by the centralized administrative government of China, overseen by the Son of Heaven.

\[list\]\[\*\]

In a Celestial Government, you have access to Influence, Noble Families, Family Estates and Treasury.

\[list\]<\*>

Independent Rulers have Legitimacy, while Vassals in a Celestial Realms focus on gaining Merit.

<\*>

The Top Liege has the Mandate of Heaven, a special type of Legitimacy tied to the Dynastic Cycle.

\[\*\]

New Province Administration types: Several new province types are split into two categories — Military and Civilian. Creating two distinct career paths for a character to pursue.

\[list\]<\*>

Capabilities vary, with Military provinces being able to hire Title Men-at-Arms while a Civilian cannot.

<\*>

They have their own Governor Contracts.

\[\*\]

Merit: Merit is a measurement of your worthiness as an official for the Celestial and Meritocratic governments.

\[list\]\[\*\]

You can earn Merit by participating in Examinations, Debates, constructing buildings, going on an Inspection Activity, using a Mentoring scheme, and generally, by being a good governor.

\[\*\]

You can increase your Merit Rank by passing the Local, Capital and Palace Examinations.

<\*>

If you have an Elder or Disciples, you can produce a passive Merit gain. The monthly merit gain can be increased by paying more taxes (for Civilian governors), or by creating Men-at-Arms (for Military governors).

<\*>

You can use the Children’s Examination to further the education of your children, giving them an initial boost of Merit and some Dynasty Prestige.

\[\*\]

Treasury: A new resource that acts as a complement to Gold for Celestial, Meritocratic and Administrative realms. It is the currency you spend on official business, such as constructing buildings, recruiting Title Men-at-Arms, and hosting certain Activities.

\[list\]\[\*\]

Governors collect and send taxes up towards the central government.

\[\*\]

The central government put the collect taxes into the Treasury, which gets redistributed down to Governors and Ministers who all receive a small share depending on the realm’s Treasury Budget

\[\*\]

A budget can be tailored to suit each need and defines how large a share each Budget Category should receive. Each category is then divided amongst the receivers.

<\*>

Officials receive a salary that is paid out of the Treasury, but is received as Gold. A salary is set according to their governed titles and Merit Rank.

<\*>

Added a scheme allowing characters to siphon the Treasury out of a Title

\[\*\]

New Activities: Added Local and Capital Examinations. These activities let you earn Merit either by succeeding fairly or trying to cheat the system.

The Local Examination is eligible for all government types that use Merit. It is held by local officials for the selected men of the prefecture, where entrants can try to complete the Provincial Examination.

<\*>

The Capital Examination is accessible in Celestial Government only. Entrants can complete the Metropolitan Examination and the Palace Examination, held by the Huangdí. The Palace Examination is the highest level examination, where entrants are judged before the Son of Heaven himself.

\[\*\]

New Succession Laws:

\[list\]<\*>

Celestial Appointment Succession — A default succession for civilian provinces, where Merit is the deciding factor, but age, Dynastic Movements, and Confucian values, all contribute to a higher candidate score.

<\*>

Celestial Commander Succession — Merit is still the primary factor of who is appointed to military provinces, but individual candidate score is based on Martial skill, Prowess, Commander Traits, and other military qualities.

\[\*\]

New Provincial Laws:

\[list\]\[\*\]

The decision will let you visit a location within your own realm or perform a sacrifice in your capital in return for some piety. Lessening the need to go to faraway pilgrimage sites.

\[\*\]

Dynastic Change: When a new House takes hold of the Hegemony of China, they trigger a Dynastic Change.

\[list\]<\*>

Dynastic Change can happen in China from a warlord collecting enough territory in the Chaotic Era, or via an internal power struggle from the Grand Secretariat, or by conquest from a foreign ruler.

<\*>

\[\*\]

Pietyplays a large role in the Mandala government and Mandala rulers have access to a higher Level of Devotion: Godlike.

\[\*\]

The number of Direct Vassals are limited under the Mandala Government Form. Instead, the Liege and Suzerain are reliant on Tributaries for expanding their realms.

\[list\]\[\*\]

The Mandala Realms thrive under good kings and wane under unpopular ones, as tributaries can easily abandon a ruler that is not worthy. Successful kings aim to be seen as gods.

\[\*\]

It is important to maintain Opinion and grow relations with your Tributaries in an effort to keep them long-term.

<\*>

It pays off to groom your heir; on Mandala Succession your Tributaries may scatter unless the ruler can prove to be a worthy Devaraja Successor.

<\*>

As a Tributary of a Mandala, you can perform Tribute Missions to pay your respects and tribute to the God King, gaining more legitimacy and prestige in their local realm in return.

\[\*\]

<\*>

Rituals change depending on what Aspect you have chosen.

\[\*\]

Mandala Capital Temple Complexes

\[list\]\[\*\]

Through the use of Great Projects, tributaries and rulers of Mandala realms can fund big Capital Temples to the glory of the God-King.

<\*>

These buildings will show on the map and will provide bonuses to be able to hold more land, more direct vassals and to grow a larger permanent realm.

<\*>

They also provide a certain portion of Radiance.

\[\*\]

Radiant God-Kings

\[list\]\[\*\]

A Mandala ruler can aspire to be seen as a God-King, or Devaraja, and then relies on Mandala Radiance to acquire and keep Tributaries.

New Government Type: Wanua

\[list\]\[\*\]

A new maritime Tribal type government for the islands of Southeast Asia. Wanua realms generally have smaller domains and fewer vassals than mainland Tribals, but make up for it with bonuses to traveling over water, new building lines, and access to Bartering. They can also release subjects as Wanua Tributaries, who are more ‘sticky’ and provide more bonuses than standard subjugated tributaries.

\[\*\]

Wanua rulers earn very little Gold from buildings, but they are able to cross the seas to raid and barter far more effectively than their continental Tribal counterparts.

\[list\]<\*>

This Government form allows the Raiding of foreign Counties for Loot.

A government form similar to Celestial, in which characters can be appointed as Civil or Military governors, used by Silla, Goryeo, Dai Viet, Dali, Xia, and Balhae

\[\*\]

You have access to Influence, Noble Families, Family Estates, Treasury

<\*>

Independent rulers have Legitimacy, while Vassals focus on obtaining merit.

<\*>

Upon reaching Empire tier, a Ceremonial Monarch title will be created, and the realm will adopt Meritocratic Regency succession, allowing a bureaucrat to take power as a Ruling Regent.

\[\*\]

New Government Type: Meritocratic Khanate

\[list\]\[\*\]

A fusion of the nomadic way of life with the Confucian bureaucracy of the centralized Chinese Administrative government, used by Great Liao and Jin

\[\*\]

This government keeps Nomadic Tributaries, who are required to aid them during wars, making for powerful swarms of highly potent units.

\[\*\]

This is a government form similar to Celestial and Meritocratic, but originating from Nomadic governments.

<\*>

Like in Meritocratic governments, you have access to Influence, Noble Families, Family Estates, Merit, and Treasury. Rulers have Legitimacy rather than Merit.

<\*>

Like in Nomadic governments, you can still enforce Obedience, maintain Tributaries and have a higher maximum Dread.
